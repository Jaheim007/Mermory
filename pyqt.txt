Before creating my designer interface I create three folders and name them:
UI, Widget and Static 

Within the (UI) folder will contain my interface which I created using pyqt designer:
Exemple:(design.ui)

Then within the (Widget) folder will contain any python file that I will use execept the file (main.py)
which I use to execute the application. 

And finally, the (Static) folder will contain any images I used in the interface.

After this phase, I open the folder in my code editor.

Once the code editor is open, I convert the UI file into a python file using the code:

Exemple:
pyuic5 -x filename.ui -o filename.py 

Then I convert the resource.qrc file into a python file using the code:

Exemple:
pyrcc5 -o filename.py resource.qrc

And to finish, I create two extra python file which in one file will contain all the conditons I want to use in the interface.
Exemple:

from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow, QWidget, QMessageBox
from Widget.filename import class_name

def __init__(self):    
    super().__init__()
    self.setupUi(self)
    self.start_now_btn.clicked.connect(self.started)

The another file which is the (main.py) to run my program

import sys 
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QApplication, QMainWindow
from Widget.filename import class_name


def main():
    app = QApplication(sys.argv)
    home = Project()
    home.show()
    app.exec_()


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

I do this in order not to mix my interface which my conditons and make the code long.

FIN
